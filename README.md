# Vocab_Finder_v2
 Vocab Finder is a tool to help ESL teachers quickly find information on lists of vocabulary words.

# Why?
 ESL teachers need to know their vocabulary well but even the most season professional must look up nuanced meanings. When it is one or two words, using a standard dictionary works well. However, when that list grows longer, considerable time must be spent searching, selecting, copying, pasting and formatting.

 ESL students also benefit from having access to accurate vocabulary lists which include the type of word, definitions and examples. This information contributes to a strong foundational entry and reference point.

 This site was created while teaching an intensive English language course. This course was test focused (reading, writing, speaking, listening) and the course book was not linked to the tests. This meant that students may encounter vocabulary words they have never seen before. To assist them in these practice tests, I would prepare lists of the words they may not know. As the lists were usually around 30 words long, creating them was time consuming.
 
# How?
 Add your list of words into the search bar with a comma between each one and hit enter.
 Your words will be searched using the merriam-webster dictionary.
 Using the arrows in each column, find the specific word, definition and example.
